mkdir

# Index

## batch mkdir.bat

Dumb way to create directories from a beginning date to end date 


Formatting: yyyy-mm-dd


###  Supposed to 
```
SET variable%=20190101

//loop increase the date to end date
    mkdir %variable%

//end

```

### What I have done

created a excel file, then with auto increasing date down the column, concat with mkdir

copied it into the .at file
